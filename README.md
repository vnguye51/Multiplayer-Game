#Real-time Multiplayer Socket Game

#Description
* This game is a persistent "MMO" world. Any number of players can work together to traverse the dungeon and defeat the boss. Progress is shared between all players. No enemies respawn so even if a player falls he is sure to have created progress for others. If a floor is completed all new players that join will also start on the next floor. The world does not reset until the boss is defeated.

* For now, this is a proof of concept. 

#Technologies
* The game is powered by Socket.IO and Phaser3 
* Communication
