## Socket Notes

* socket.emit sends a signal to the client that triggered the "on" event handler
* socket.broadcast.emit sends a signal to ALL clients

## Creating class objects(to help separate code)

# Notes
* looking at the docs, it seems that sprites and images have no functional difference. They just kept in both for legacy reasons.
* update() is called in every single game object that Phaser is tracking.
    * i.e. if there is a function called update() inside the enemy class it will be called every frame.

## Creating an Enemy
* Add enemies as a constructor in enemiesServer.js
* Use Tier1Melee as a template
* the update() method is called at a tickrate of 30fps

* Near the end of update:
    this.x += this.xvel
    this.y += this.yvel
    
* Is called. The script should affect the velocity/acceleration of the enemy and then the position is updated based on that.

* Some possible useful functions are added at the end such as
    * angleBetween
    * unitVector
